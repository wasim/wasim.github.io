# Wasim Akram

Principal Data & AI Engineer @ [VML MAP (WPP)](https://www.vml.com/)  
P1 Affiliated Researcher @ [AI Centre Denmark](https://www.aicentre.dk/) · Copenhagen, Denmark

I build reliable agentic AI systems, production data platforms, and study how sparsity and modularity emerge inside dense language models. Current focus: turning interpretability insights into measurable efficiency wins.

## Snapshot

- **Day role:** Lead enterprise ML/AI platforms, cost-aware inference, and activation-aware monitoring for production systems.
- **Research track:** [Scaling Specialization in Dense LMs](https://github.com/wasim/scaling-specialization-dense-lms) — measuring activation sparsity, extracting monosemantic features with SAEs, and prototyping dynamic-k execution.
- **Study plan:** Working through [Antikythera – What Is Intelligence?](https://whatisintelligence.antikythera.org/) while replicating Anthropic interpretability studies to stay grounded before extending the frontier.
- **Interests:** mechanistic interpretability, sparse autoencoders, scaling laws, activation-efficient inference, trustworthy evaluation.

## Current Research Plan

1. **Measure specialization** across the Pythia suite (70M → 1B+) using activation sparsity, specialization index, and modularity metrics.
2. **Recover interpretable features** via sparse autoencoders; score monosemanticity and map circuits tied to probe tasks (IOI, arithmetic, induction, POS/NER).
3. **Exploit structure for efficiency** using dynamic-k gating and targeted ablations to validate causal roles while keeping perplexity flat.
